# MongoDB for MERN Stack

MERN: MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS, Node.JS

I have created this repository as a self reference. It consists of general pointers for using Mongo DB in a MERN Stack application

**Installation of MongoDB**
- `npm install  mongodb --save`
- This is essentially a MongoDB driver that will take commands to connect and send queries to and from the MongoDB cloud server (Mongo Atlas)

**Installation of Mongoose**
- `npm install mongoose --save`
- It uses schemas - gives you better of control of the structure of documents you want to store in the database
